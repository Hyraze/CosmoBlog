##Have you been a Zoho Developer?!:)

     It was really challenging in the beginning to **learn Zoho**.But, eventually got adjusted to the environment.There is a seperate language designed only for Zoho,which is said to be for non programmers.Though it is easy for a beginner, still it is difficult to understand the way it works, since Zoho has its own way of describing things.
